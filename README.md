UNIs: [ww2572, kz2386]

Wei Wang is responsible for part 1 and part 2.  
Keying Zhou is responsible for part 3 and part 4.

## Summary
In part 1, we cleaned three whole datasets and normalize everything. For taxi data file, to save time, we save the sample file in our computer after loading from the URLs.

In part 2, we use SQLite database to store all data obtained in part 1 in the project.db database. If the database file already exists, we delete it and create our new database.

In part 3, we use advanced SQL queries to select data we need to answer questions.

In part 4, we use multiple modules to plot different graphs.
